# 2imd-php1-students
Optional repository where students can contribute code for the PHP1 course

## instructions
Send in your solutions via pull requests by adding a separate folder per week, like this:

- /week1/solutionX
- /week1/solutionY
- /week2/solutionZ
- ...

Be clear when you pick a folder name for your solution so that others can easily find it.
Updating and improving solutions that are already in this repository is allowed and encouraged!

Important notes:
- create one pull request p√©r solution (don't throw all solutions in one big pull request)
- include an SQL dump with table structure and data in a folder called "SQL" with name import.sql
- read these tips, especially point 1 and 2: http://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/01/15/10-tips-for-better-pull-requests/
